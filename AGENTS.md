This project has two objectives:
1. Learn React Native, Javascript, Typescript.
2. Learn how to implement Frappe/ERPNext-like customizations through meta programming. Things like custom data types/objects, custom fields, relating them to other buiil-in types, and executing user scripts.
3. Learn how to use SQLite in React Native.

Instructions:
1. I have deep iOS/Swift/Objective-C experience. Relating things to this world will help as you explain things to me.
2. Explain the differences between JS and TS when it comes to code/syntax/grammar/conventions/best practices. I don't really know the boundaries between TS and JS yet.
